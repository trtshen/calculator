# tnb-bill-calculator
Calculate your household electricity bill for 2016

Demo: https://trtshen.github.io/tnb-bill-calculator/

Features:
- Predict your consumable kWh by assumed expense amount
- Check cost with kWh consumption

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 with modern JSX
- **Build System**: Parcel bundler for zero-config compilation
- **Calculation Logic**: Separated JavaScript utilities (`src/billCalculations.js`)
- **Components**: Modular React components (`src/components.js`)

```

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm

### Installation
```bash
npm install
```

### Development Server
To run the development server with hot reload:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Then visit `http://localhost:1234`

### Production Build
To compile the application into static files for hosting:
```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `dist/` directory with all the compiled static files that can be served by any web server.

### Hosting on GitHub Pages
After building, the contents of the `dist/` directory can be deployed to GitHub Pages or any static hosting service:

1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Copy contents of `dist/` directory to your web server or GitHub Pages repository
3. The application will run as a standalone static webapp

## Features
All calculations work identically to the original:
```javascript
// Example: 350 kWh consumption
calculateBill(350) // Returns: {total: "97.48", gst: "1.50", icpt: "5.32", gstTotal: "98.98"}

// Example: RM200 budget prediction  
calculateConsumable(200) // Returns: "524" kWh
```

The application maintains the same user interface and behavior while providing a cleaner, more maintainable codebase with properly separated concerns and modern React development practices.
